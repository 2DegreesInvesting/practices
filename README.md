# practices

This document intends to document how we develop software at 2DII, including
social and technical aspects around a number of themes. It should help guide
our actions,  and understand what to expect from our colleagues and what they
expect from us.  Wherever possible, we refer to the source of information
that defines a “best practice”. Anecdotes and personal experience have
value, but we prefer evidence from research, books, and large and mature
communities of practice.
