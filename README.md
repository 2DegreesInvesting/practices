# practices

This document intends to document how we develop software at 2DII, including
social and technical aspects around a number of themes. It should help guide
our actions,  and understand what to expect from our colleagues and what they
expect from us.  Wherever possible, we refer to the source of information
that defines a "best practice". Anecdotes and personal experience have
value, but we prefer evidence from research, books, and large and mature
communities of practice.

We have agreed to this practices by consensus. We document _what_ to do and
_why_, and only recommend optional resources about _how_ to do it. These
practices are aspirational but when they can't be followed it's nice to explain
why. They document heuristics, as detailed instructions may never cover all
scenarios.
